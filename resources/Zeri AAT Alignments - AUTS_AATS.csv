,e aiuti,The artist in AUTN/ AAT and a few other anonymous ones,300,assistant to not exactly,"Qualifier used for attributions of works by an unknown creator working as an assistant to a named artist, architect, or other creator whose staff is relatively small in number and do not call themselves a studio or an office. Also use for an assistant who worked in a studio or office, but in a special, close relationship to the named artist or architect.                                                             By all terms beginning with ""e"" (and) we rather mean that the work was made by the named artist, who was primarily responsible for it, but in collaboration with someone else in his or her workshop whose identity is unknown. The latter could be assistants within the atelier (e aiuti, e collaboratore/i, e scuola), or someone who worked shortly after (e seguace/i). This was quite common in the ateliers of Renaissance artists where the master made the main parts of a work and then it was completed by the pupils/assistants. Do you think there is a correct way to express this concept?

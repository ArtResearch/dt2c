272,Irlanda,,,Dublino,Dublin,Dublin,,,,inhabited places,"The city of Dublin, the present capital of the Republic of Ireland, has been inhabited since ancient times. It is situated in the eastern part of the country at the head of Dublin Bay on the Irish Sea. Norsemen settled the spot ca 831, and fought off the Irish until 1014. They later reclaimed the town and it survived and prospered as a Norse settlement though eventually the Norse rulers had Irish overlords. Henry II established English influence in 1170, which continued until 1922. Dublin remained a small medieval walled town, ruling only the English enclave along the coast, called the Pale. Dublin became Protestant around the time of the Reformation, and surrendered to Oliver Cromwell's army in 1649. Much damaged, depopulated, and physically crumbling, the town underwent a dramatic reversal of fortune in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the arrival of French Huguenot weavers fleeing persecution, soon followed by Flemish weavers. Dublin's thriving cloth trade lead to economic prosperity and the growth of the city beyond its old walls. Much fine Georgian architecture was built. The English elite thrived while the Roman Catholic majority was largely kept in extreme poverty and suffered persecution under the harsh Penal Laws. Reforms improved the status of Catholics in the 19th century but inequity continued and armed conflict centered on Dublin.

In the eleventh century it was the residence of the counts of Leuven, and later of Brabant from 1190. It grew to be a major cloth producer and one of the largest cities in Europe in 14th century, but declined after a citizens' revolt in 1379 was put down and many of its weavers fled to England and Flanders. The Catholic University of Leuven was founded in 1425, making the city famous as a seat of learning. In1914, when Germany invaded it, the university's famous library and the Cloth Workers' Hall, built1193, were burned. It sustained much damage in both World Wars. It nevertheless continues to be a center of culture, famed for its pointed Gothic town hall, built by Mathieu de Layens, the master mason, from 1448 to 1463. The Church of St. Peter, built first in the early 11th century, was twice destroyed before being rebuilt as a Gothic structure in1425-97, and it was again damaged in both world wars. The church contains two fine paintings by Dirck Bouts and fine ironwork and brasswork, much of it by Quentin Massys. Other notable medieval buildings include the ""Round Table,"" churches of St. Gertrude, St. Quentin, Saint-Michel, and St. James, two monasteries, and a béguinage, or retreat for secular nuns, with a 1305 church.

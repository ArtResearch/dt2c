In the late 16th century, the city's trade began to prosper and the city extended its boundaries. It was besieged by Sweden, 1658-1660, and bombarded by the British in 1801 and 1807. Its ramparts were torn down in 1856 and the city continued to grow, reaching out to incorporate many nearby towns. It was occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. Despite the sackings and two major fires in the 18th century, much remains of the city's historic architecture, a lot of it now converted to administrative and academic use. In the King's New Square, laid out in the 17th century, are the Thott Palace, now the French Embassy, and the Charlottenberg Palace, now the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Christiansborg Palace on the islet of Slotsholmen, built on the ruins of the castle built there in 1167, now houses the Danish Parliament, Supreme Court, and Foreign Office. Other notable structures include the Petri Church, which after 1585 became the parish church for the German residents, the 17th-century citadel, and the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479. The city has been a center of commerce and shipping since medieval times, and is now also an industrial center with shipbuilding, brewing, canning, and machinery manufacture being major activities. For institutions of higher learning, besides the University of Copenhagen, are the Royal Academy of Music (1867), the Technical University of Denmark (1829), the Engineering Academy of Denmark (1957), and the Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration (1917).

Napoleon I annexed it to the French Empire in 1810, and after his fall it joined the German Confederation, all the while retaining its traditional self-government to a large degree.

It was heavily damaged and rebuilt in the Thirty Years' War and in the prelude to the War of the Grand Alliance in the 17th century. The Electors of Palatine moved their residence there in 1720, and built many structures in the Baroque style, notably the Jesuit Church, the castle, the town hall, and the pilgrimage church. The city became a center of high culture in the 18th century, which it has remained to this day, famous for its music, art museum, and Germany's National Theater. Destroyed again in 1795, it was once more rebuilt and was a center of revolutionary activity in 1848-1849. A harbor constructed there on the Rhine in 1834 encouraged economic and industrial activity. The city was heavily damaged again in World War II, but most of its principal historic buildings have been restored. Its principal manufactures include textiles, chemicals, fertilizer, and food products, and coal and iron are traded through its river harbor.

It was a free imperial city from 1372 to 1806, then Napoleon I made it first the seat of government for the Confederation of the Rhine, then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt.

Following the Seven Weeks' War in 1866, it fell under Prussian rule where it remained until after World War I. It suffered heavy damage from bombardment in World War II, and most of its medieval Old City was destroyed. Historic structures that survived include the 8th-century Benedictine monastery, the Römer or medieval city hall, the 155-foot Eschenheim Tower, St. Bartholomew's Cathedral dating from 1239, and the Church of St. Paul.

Conversely, the unitary authority includes three small areas that are part of the historic county of Worcestershire: the parishes of Edvin Loach and Acton Beauchamp and an area including West Malvern and Mathon. Herefordshire is predominantly agricultural and is known for its hop production (surpassed only by Kent), pear and apple orchards, and the famous Hereford breed of cattle. The chief river is the Wye and the administrative center is Hereford. There are several notable prehistoric sites here, including Sutton Walls, Croft Ambrey, Herefordshire Beacon, and Leintwardine. Ruined 12th-century Norman fortresses still stand at Wilton, Goodrich, and Pembridge. The Herefordshire school of Romanesque architecture is exemplified in Kilpeck's Church of St. Mary and St. David and the 13th-century Treago is a notable fortified mansion.

7,Germany,,Braunschweig,Braunschweig,Brunswick,,Braunschweig,,inhabited places,"The city of Braunschweig is located on the Oker River some 38 miles southeast of Hanover in the state of Lower Saxony in northern Germany. According to tradition, Bruno of Saxony founded it in the 9th century. Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, gave it its charter and developed it in the 12th century. It joined the Hanseatic League in the 13th century and prospered, but civil unrest caused it to decline. It revived far enough to become the capitol city of the state of Brunswick after the First World War, but then suffered heavy bombardment and severe damage in the Second. It was rebuilt and some of its historic architecture was restored. Medieval buildings include the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Blasius, containing the tomb of Henry the Lion, four medieval churches, the castle Burg Dankwarderode, which houses the Treasures of the Guelph family, and, in the castle square, a large statue of a lion, a memorial to Henry the Lion, carved in 1166.

First established as a Roman settlement; a chapel was erected here by St. Eloi in 7th century. It was a thriving producer of linen damask in medieval times. The inhabitants defeated the French cavalry here in 1302 in what came to be famed as the ""Battle of the Golden Spurs"", but the town was sacked in revenge in 1382. Captured by the Germans in World War I, it became a major base for the Ypres front. Like much of the Flanders region, it was severely damaged in World War II. Its art and architecture include the Broelbrug, a bridge built around 1400 with two massive towers, Anthony Van Dyck's painting ""Elevation of the Cross"", executed in 1631, housed in the church of Notre Dame, 1191-1211 which also features the conjoining chapel of the counts of Flanders, dating from 1374. Other notable structures are the St. Martin's Church in Gothic style, a 14th century belfry, and the Flamboyant Gothic town hall built in the 15th and 16th centuries.

It passed to Burgundy in 1421, and to the new nation of Belgium with the rest of the Burgundian Netherlands in 1830. Its strategic location on the various routes into France meant that the city was often the scene of conflict in the 17th and from the 19th to the 20th centuries. It underwent considerable damage during both World Wars. Despite this, many historic structures remain, such as the Baroque cathedral of St. Aubain, the Jesuit church of St. Loup, the convent of the Sisters of Our Lady, containing 13th-century treasures of silver and gold craftsmanship; and the Meat Hall, built in 1588, which houses the archaeological museum.

It was the site of Roman baths from the1st century BCE. It probably was birthplace of Charlemagne, who adopted the city as the second capital of the Holy Roman Empire and made it a center of learning and culture. From medieval times to the Reformation it served as the main coronation place of emperors and German kings. Destroyed in 881, it was rebuilt and in the late 12 century was fortified and obtained civic rights. It became a free imperial city around 1250. It began a decline in the 16th century, ceased to be the seat of imperial coronations in 1560, and was almost entirely burned in a great conflagration in 1656. It was the site of the signing of treaties to end the wars of Devolution in 1688 and of Austrian Succession in 1748. Annexed by France in 1801, it fell to Prussia by the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. Belgium occupied it briefly after World War I, and in World War II it was the first large German city to be taken by the Allies, in October 1944. Despite the bombing, much of its historic architecture has survived, in at least restored or rebuilt condition. Aachen Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site, includes the famous Palatine Chapel of the Carolingian era, built between 790 and 805. Its choir and side chapels are Gothic. Notable medieval churches include St. Foillan's, St. Nicholas's, and St. Paul's, all of which began reconstruction right after being damaged. The town hall of around 1530 on the ruins of Charlemagne's palace and containing the wonderful Hall of the Emperors has also been restored. Culturally Aachen is am important city, with the Suermondt Ludwig Museum of Art in the market square, the international Newspaper Museum with examples of newspapers dating back to the 16th century, and many educational institutions, including the first university ever founded in Prussia (1870). The warmest ho springs in Germany are located in the suburb of Burtscheid. Aachen is also a center of industry and commerce, with nearly every type of heavy industry represented there. Goods such as chemicals, textiles, plastics, machinery, glass, electronics, and cosmetics are produced there. The estimated population for 2004 was 249,200.","city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7004799,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1017,

It is located in an area known as Breckland that was once a great expanse of sandy heath; today the area is planted with pine forests and little open heath remains. Although Thetford lost most of its political power in the early Middle Ages, remains of its impressive fortifications exist. Castle Hill, an earthwork on the town's eastern outskirts, is the largest mound in East Anglia at 81 feet high and almost 1000 feet around the base. A Norman castle at Castle Hill was supposedly torn down in 1173. The Normans made Thetford into a major religious center; it was the seat of the bishops of East Anglia in the 11th century. The noted remains of a Cluniac priory founded ca. 1104 are still here; St. Cuthbert's is the only medieval church of Thetford still in use. Thetford was also a royal retreat with the King's House (now home to the Thetford Council) as a hunting lodge used into the 17th century. There was an attempt in the 19th century to make Thetford, with its mineral springs, into a spa town. Thomas Paine was born here in 1737.",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7012015,,

This site near an artesian spring in the vast desert was used by Native American populations. Later it was a resting spot for travelers along the Spanish trail to Texas. In 1855 Brigham Young sent missionaries here to convert the Paiute Indian population. They built a fort near the current downtown area. Nineteenth-century Las Vegas was a stopover for travelers along the Mormon Corridor between Salt Lake and San Bernardino, California, then a Mormon center. Las Vegas was abandoned by the Mormons in 1857, but expanded again with the railways ca. 1905 and then with the construction of the nearby Hoover Dam in 1931. Gambling was legalized in 1931; large scale population increase and the construction of big hotels and casinos began after WW II. It grew from a tiny, desert-bound railroad service center at the outset of the 20th century to become the country's fastest-growing metropolis at century's end. The name ""Las Vegas"" is often applied to the town and the unincorporated areas of Clark County that surround the city, especially the resort areas on and near the Las Vegas Strip, which is for the most part outside the city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester. This metropolitan area, with more than twice the number of people outside the city limits as within them, contains around three-fourths of the state's population.","city and county seat of Clark County, Nevada, United States",http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7013870,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23768,

It is the second largest city in the nation. The locality shows traces of Neolithic and Cro-Magnon inhabitants, and of Celtic and Slavic settlements in historic times. The town began developing with German colonization in the 13th century, and became an incorporated city in 1243. The margraves of Moravia took the city in the 14th century and held it successfully until the 18th century, despite several sieges. French troops occupied it in 1805 before Napoleon's victory over united Austrian and Russian forces southeast of Brno at Slavkoy. The city then fell under the rule of the Austrian Hapsburg emperors, and the famous Spilberk Castle became a notorious prison. The monk and geneticist Gregor Mendel lived and worked at the monastery at Brno. The Gothic church of that monastery survives, as do many other old buildings in the old town. Brno today is an educational and industrial center, known for its international trade fairs. It is famed as the lifetime home of the Czech composer Leos Janacek.

French pilgrimage routes to Compostela tend to follow old Roman roads, many of which continued to be utilized as primary roads of communication during the Middle Ages. Le Puy is a site of unknown antiquity, although estimated to have gone through a period of Roman habitation. Pilgrimages from Le Puy to Compostela began as early as the 6th century. This city became the starting location for one of the four main pilgrimage routes, specifically for German and Teutonic pilgrims. Le Puy is a manufacturing city, located in south-central France in the mountainous volcanic region. It is the site of the 12th-century Romanesque Cathedral of Notre-Dame as well as a Gothic church.",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7008205,,

Salt mines opened here in the 12th century, sparking a long rivalry over the trade with nearby Salzburg. The town was ruled by the provosts of the Augustinian abbey from 1300. Austria occupied it in 1704 and annexed it in 1805. After 1810, after a brief period of French rule, it was ceded to the kingdom of Bavaria. Some medieval architecture remains, notably the abbey church and the castle occupied first by the provost-rulers then by the kings of Bavaria in the warm summer months.

Native Irish under Brian Boru ousted the Norse and it remained in Irish hands until the early 13th century, when King John granted it to an Anglo-Norman noble who founded English Town in the settlement and built fortifications. In the 15th century, fortifications were erected around the entire town, comprised of English Town on the old center of King's Island, and Irish Town on the bank of the Shannon. In 1691, William III of Great Britain conquered it. A third sector, Newtown Perry, was established in 1769 on the bank opposite to Irish Town; the three sectors are linked by bridges. Limerick has a protestant Cathedral, built from 1142 to 1180, and a modern Roman Catholic Cathedral designed in Early Pointed style. It was made a county borough in 1888.

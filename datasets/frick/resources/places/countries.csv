Under Roman rule in the 2nd century BCE, a Greater Armenia was formed. Over the following centuries, the area was conquered by Persians, Byzantines, and Arabs. In the 11th century CE, a second Armenian state was formed in the Cicilian Plane, to the west. Greater Armenia was the subject of several power struggles until it lost its autonomy in the 14th century. Eastern Armenia was appended to Russia in the 19th century. Western Armenia was controlled by Turkey, and in the late-19th to the early-20th centuries, the country's populace was the subject of massacres and deportations by the Turks. In 1920, the Soviet Republic of Armenia was established, later dissolving in 1936, with Armenia becoming a separate constituent republic of the Soviet Union. In 1991, Armenia declared independence from the Soviet Union. Although the Soviets had helped to modernize the country, the 1990s brought an economic crisis which has seen a fifth of the population emigrate. Major industries in Armenia include chemicals, clothing, and machinery, as well as textiles.

The country was inhabited in 100,000 BCE, but recorded history began with the Elmites in 3000 BCE. Three major dynasties of this pre-Islamic era are the Persian (550-331 BCE), the Parthian (250 BCE- 224 CE) and the Sassanian (224-651 CE). The Persians were able to establish an empire with the help of Cyrus the Great. This dynasty collapsed in 331 BCE when Alexander the Great conquered the region. After the fall of the Seleucid, Parthian, Bactrian, and Sassanian empires, the non-Persian Islamic princes began their rule. Following this period came the Safavid (1502-1736) dynasty (marking an Írānian state with roughly the same boundaries as present-day Írān) and the Qājār (1779-1921) dynasty. During Qājār rule, European intervention in Iranian politics began to elevate. After a famine and bankruptcy in 1921 the last of the Qājār kings, Nāser od-Dīn Shāh and Mozzaffar od-Dīn Shāh, set the grounds for Reza Khan's takeover, effectively beginning the last Persian dynasty, the Pahlavi (1921-1979 CE). Khan's son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (1941-1979 CE), took power, and fled the country in 1979, giving way to the Islamic Republic of Írān.",country in Western Asia,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7000231,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q794,IR,

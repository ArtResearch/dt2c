There is a history of human settlement in the area from Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Celtic periods. The site of Prague itself was settled by the second half of the ninth century CE.

It was a brilliant medieval center, with a university founded in 1348 that drew scholars from all over Europe. The city grew to cover both banks of the Vltava River. Prague was the scene of Hussite rebellions in the early 15th century, ultimately put down with much violence by the Hapsburg emperors of Austria who became rulers of Bohemia. The religious strife plus two outbursts of plague sent the city into decline in the 17th century, but it revived with great economic growth in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1918, Prague became the capital of the newly founded nation of Czechoslovakia. Following the end of World War II, restoration of the older sectors and buildings of the city began to take place. In 1968, a growing liberalism within the communist state was crushed by Soviet military occupation. In 1989, rebellion against the communist government was centered in Prague, and with the establishment of the Czech Republic in 1993, it was named the capital.

The inhabitants defeated the French cavalry here in 1302 in what came to be famed as the ""Battle of the Golden Spurs"", but the town was sacked in revenge in 1382. Captured by the Germans in World War I, it became a major base for the Ypres front. Like much of the Flanders region, it was severely damaged in World War II. Its art and architecture include the Broelbrug, a bridge built around 1400 with two massive towers, Anthony Van Dyck's painting ""Elevation of the Cross"", executed in 1631, housed in the church of Notre Dame, 1191-1211 which also features the conjoining chapel of the counts of Flanders, dating from 1374. Other notable structures are the St. Martin's Church in Gothic style, a 14th century belfry, and the Flamboyant Gothic town hall built in the 15th and 16th centuries.

It was the site of Roman baths from the1st century BCE. It probably was birthplace of Charlemagne, who adopted the city as the second capital of the Holy Roman Empire and made it a center of learning and culture. From medieval times to the Reformation it served as the main coronation place of emperors and German kings. Destroyed in 881, it was rebuilt and in the late 12 century was fortified and obtained civic rights. It became a free imperial city around 1250. It began a decline in the 16th century, ceased to be the seat of imperial coronations in 1560, and was almost entirely burned in a great conflagration in 1656. It was the site of the signing of treaties to end the wars of Devolution in 1688 and of Austrian Succession in 1748. Annexed by France in 1801, it fell to Prussia by the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. Belgium occupied it briefly after World War I, and in World War II it was the first large German city to be taken by the Allies, in October 1944. Despite the bombing, much of its historic architecture has survived, in at least restored or rebuilt condition. Aachen Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site, includes the famous Palatine Chapel of the Carolingian era, built between 790 and 805. Its choir and side chapels are Gothic. Notable medieval churches include St. Foillan's, St. Nicholas's, and St. Paul's, all of which began reconstruction right after being damaged. The town hall of around 1530 on the ruins of Charlemagne's palace and containing the wonderful Hall of the Emperors has also been restored. Culturally Aachen is am important city, with the Suermondt Ludwig Museum of Art in the market square, the international Newspaper Museum with examples of newspapers dating back to the 16th century, and many educational institutions, including the first university ever founded in Prussia (1870). The warmest ho springs in Germany are located in the suburb of Burtscheid. Aachen is also a center of industry and commerce, with nearly every type of heavy industry represented there.

It sustained severe damage during the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, but revived with the founding of the University of Göttingen, which soon became known of one of the best in Europe. The dismissal of seven professors (including J and K Grimm) in 1837 caused a sharp decline in its academic reputation and hence the prosperity of the city. Strong math and physics faculties eventually restored its good name in the late 19th century. The university's library has one of the finest collections in Europe and draws many visitors. Largely undamaged during World War II, the city retains much of its historic architecture, including whole streets of medieval half-timbered buildings, the city ramparts, and several Gothic churches.

It received its charter in 1874 and developed rapidly with the industrial activity at the turn of the 20th century. It annexed two neighboring towns in 1929. Historic architecture includes the Sterkrade Abbey built in 1150, Holten Fortress built in 1307, and the 16th-century moated castle of Vondern. The modern city connects to the Netherlands via autobahn lines. As the producer of steel and bituminous coal, it hosts much heavy industry, including the historic St. Anthony's Iron Works active 1758 to 1876, the first developed in the Ruhr district. Notable 20th-century structures include the town hall built in 1930, the main railway station of 1938, and the city hall built in 1962. Cultural institutions include several technical schools a civic theatre, and an art museum.

With a manmade change in the course of the Ems River that moved its estuary farther from Emden, the city's trade and prosperity declined. It was heavily bombed in World War II, but the port facilities escaped major damage. Some other surviving structures include the remains built in 1616, the Late Gothic Great Church of 1648, the 16th-century town hall, and the 17th-century East Friesland Museum.

Surviving historic buildings are limited to three: the Propsteikirche of 1599, and, in the suburbs, the 13th-century Blankenstein Castle and an 11th-century church. The city today has a modern look, having been extensively rebuilt and expanded since 1946, and acquiring within its borders the neighboring city of Wattenscheid in 1975. Coal mining, once the main industry, ceased in 1973, and automobile manufacturing now dominates the economy.

The city was captured by Alexander the Great in 329 BCE and was subsequently ruled by the Turks (6th century CE), the Arabs (8th century), the Samanids, and later was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1220. By 1365, Samarkand had become part of the Timur empire, and was a flourishing city in the region. In 1500, the city was conquered by the Uzbeks, becoming part of the khanate of Bukhara. Samarkand had declined by the 17th century, becoming virtually uninhabited from ca. 1720-ca. 1780. Once the Russians had conquered the region, the city began to recover. Present-day Samarkand consists of an old city (containing many examples of 14th-20th century Central Asian architecture), and a 19th century section built by the Russians. In ancient times, the city had been on the Silk Road from India and China, and today its economy is largely agriculture-based. ",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7012290,,,,,,1

St. Eloi, bishop of Noyon-Tournai converted the town to Christianity, and the first counts of Flanders built a castle here in the9th century to guard against Norman invaders. It reached its height of commercial greatness in the 14th century, as one of the most important members of the Hanseatic League of trading cities. It remained rich an powerful as the site of the court of the dukes of Burgundy, rulers of Flanders, and the artistic center of the Flemish school of painting, until the religious and political turmoil of the 16th century brought about its decline. It revived with the construction ten miles away of the North Sea port of Zerbrugge and the opening in 1907 of a canal linking it to the port. It is famed for its medieval architecture and hanseatic buildings, and enjoys a thriving tourist industry in the 20th and 21st centuries.

14,Deutschland,Nordrhein-Westfalen,Köln & Heidelberg,00001471,Köln,Cologne,,Köln,,inhabited places,"The western German city of Cologne is situated on the west bank of the Rhine. The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center.

It is noted as the site of the earliest known European Iron Age culture, and thus the name has been applied to the epoch (divided into 4 periods) dating from 1000 BCE-400 BCE. During excavation between 1846 and 1899, more than 2,000 graves were found at Hallstatt. The majority fall into two groups, an earlier (ca. 1100/1000 to ca. 800/700 BCE) and a later (ca. 800/700 to 450 BCE). Near the cemetery was a prehistoric salt mine; because of the preservative nature of the salt, implements, parts of clothing, and even the bodies of the miners themselves have been discovered.

Its territory forms the core of the medieval margraviate of Hessen, and extends west to east from the Rhine Plateau to the Thuringian Forest. The original landmargraviate of Hesse was founded from a portion of Thuringia. Its ruler, Henry I, came to hold the rank of prince in the Holy Roman Empire in 1292. Under Philip the Magnanimous, Hesse was twice partitioned and reunited, finally to be divided into four sections, one for each of his sons. In 1945 the modern state was created from the Hesse territories and part of Nassau. The capital is Wiesbaden and its largest city is Frankfurt am Main. The state is known for its educational institutions, and for the ruined castles and old churches along the Weser River, and the many half-timbered houses scattered throughout. The economy features agriculture on small or large scales, and a great deal of manufacturing, primarily in the south. The 2004 estimated population was 6,105,200",state in the center of Germany,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003678,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1199,,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003678,,,1

The Arabs captured the city in 709, Bukhara became capital of the Samanid dynasty in the 9th-10th centuries, and later was captured by Genghis Khan in 1220. In 1506, it was captured by the Shaybanids, an Uzbek tribe, and the city became their capital. In 1920, the region was overthrown by the Russians (who had made the khanate of Bukhara a protectorate in 1868), and Bukhara became the capital of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic, which was then absorbed into the Uzbek S.S.R. in 1924. In the 1950s, natural gas was discovered and the city rapidly grew. Bukhara contains a number of important older structures, including the Isma'il Samani Mausoleum (9th-10th century CE), the Kalan minaret and mosque (11th century), as well as several madrasahs dating from the 15th-17th centuries.

It is bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, Germany to the south, and the strait between it and Norway and Sweden to the north. It measures some 16,639 square miles in area, not counting the independent territories of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland. The area was a seat of changing cultures in Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages. From the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Danes took part in the Viking raiding, trading, and colonizing expeditions that shaped much of Europe. The kingdom of Denmark ruled much of the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries. The boundaries of the kingdom changed often between the 14th and19th centuries, most recently in 1920. The late 19th century saw a time of depression in which Danish farmers established cooperatives and the rural population became highly literature as a result of the establishment of folk high schools. The Danish tradition of social cooperation and humane governmental institutions began around this time. Denmark was occupied militarily by Germany in World War II, but resisted with some success until the local government fell in 1943; organized resistance continued however until freedom in May of 1945. The official language is Danish, a derivative of Old Scandinavian, though English and German are also spoken. Agriculture is an important economic activity, with 60% of the land under intense cultivation, about half of that devoted to grains such as wheat and barley. The raising of sugar beets and of domestic livestock such as dairy cattle, poultry, and swine are also very important. Fishing is done in the North and Baltic Seas as well as in foreign waters far abroad. Mineral exploitation consists largely of the mining of granite, kaolin, and various clays used in the production of building materials. The major manufactures are of electronic equipment, paper, machinery and equipment, processed foods, footwear, clothing, and furniture.  The capital city is Copenhagen on the island of Zeeland.

The city and castle of Xerxes I, Darius's son, (reg 485-465 BCE), was destroyed by Alexander the Great. In 316 BCE, Persepolis became the capital of Persis, a Macedonian empire, and then began to decline during the Seleucid period (312-64 BCE). By the 3rd century CE, the neaby city of Istakhr became the center of the Sasanian empire. Investigation of Persepolis' ruins began in 1618 by García Silva Figueroa, a Spanish ambassador to Persia who found references of the ancient city in the works by Quintus Curtius, Diodorus and Plutarch. In 1626, Englishman Thomas Herbert, published the first engraving of the ruins.

It was founded by free miners in the 12th century and fast became an influential silver-mining center, and home of the mining code ""Freiberger Stadtrecht,"" established in 1296. It was the largest city in Saxony until the 16th century, its economic center and home to its mint. The Reformation was introduced here by Henry the Pious in 1536. The Thirty Years War of the 17th century and the French occupation of 1806 to 1814 inflicted great destruction on Freiberg. It never quite regained its former high status. The silver mines closed in 1913, and in 1936 the lead, zinc, and pyrites mines became state property. The modern town is still a mining center and now also has manufacturing industries for porcelain, electrical and precision instruments, leather, textiles, and machinery. Its historic architecture includes its Old City, which has three sections: the Civitas Saxonium, which is a network of narrow alleys around the St. Nicholas Church, the Lower Market, and the Upper City with its wealth of medieval building, including the town hall, 1410-1416, the cathedral, 1484-1501 with its 1230 Golden Portal from an earlier church, and some remaining sections of the old town wall. The Freiberg Mining Academy, founded 1765, is the world's oldest mining education institution.

It lay on trade route between Köln and Magdeburg. A bishopric was founded there by Louis I the Pious, the son of Charlemagne. The city flourished under the prelates Bernward and Gotthard in the 11th century, and it had joined Hanseatic League by the time it received its charter in 1300. The city accepted the Protestant Reformation in 1542, though its bishops continued as princes of the Holy Roman Empire until 1803, when Prussia annexed the city. It changed hands again in 1815, passing into the possession of Hanover. It lost most of its historic architecture during the bombing of World War II, but a few have been reconstructed, among them the cathedral, with art treasures from the 11th century, and St, Michael's Church, which has a 12th century-painted ceiling. Other surviving structures are the Gothic town hall, St. Gotthard's Church, and the Tempelhaus, built 1484-90.  Its industries include the manufacture of agricultural equipment, radio and television equipment, and cooking stoves.

It lies on the historically important salt route to Prague. It was chartered in 1143. In 1308 it was taken over by the Wettin family of Meissen. It was granted a textile-bleaching monopoly in 1357, which inspired a prosperous linen industry. In the 19th century machine construction began in Chemnitz, facilitated by the growing expansion of coal and lignite production in Saxony. It is noted for the creation of the first spinning wheel, the first machine tools, and the first locomotive in Germany. It was severely damaged in World War II, but was rebuilt. Historic structures include the 1496 town hall, the medieval Red Tower, and a former Benedictine monastery of 1136 with a Gothic hall church that is now a museum. Chemnitz is a center for education, having a college of education, a school of machine construction, and several technical schools. It is a transportation hub and an industrial center with both heavy and light industries, notably for a wide variety of textiles. The calculated population for 2005 was 246,654.","city in Saxony, Germany",http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7005951,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2795,,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7005951,,,1

It is the second largest city in the nation. The locality shows traces of Neolithic and Cro-Magnon inhabitants, and of Celtic and Slavic settlements in historic times. The town began developing with German colonization in the 13th century, and became an incorporated city in 1243. The margraves of Moravia took the city in the 14th century and held it successfully until the 18th century, despite several sieges. French troops occupied it in 1805 before Napoleon's victory over united Austrian and Russian forces southeast of Brno at Slavkoy. The city then fell under the rule of the Austrian Hapsburg emperors, and the famous Spilberk Castle became a notorious prison. The monk and geneticist Gregor Mendel lived and worked at the monastery at Brno. The Gothic church of that monastery survives, as do many other old buildings in the old town. Brno today is an educational and industrial center, known for its international trade fairs. It is famed as the lifetime home of the Czech composer Leos Janacek.

It was founded as a Franconian settlement in the 8th century. It passed to the rule of the Bishop of Bamberg in 1007, although both Ansbach and Nürnberg claimed it. Destroyed in the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, it came under the sovereignty of Bavaria in 1806 and was chartered in 1808. It was bombed in World War II due to the presence of airplane factories. Historic architecture includes the St. Michel's Church built in the 12th and 14 centuries, and the nineteenth-century town hall. A rail line between Fürth and Nürnberg was the first in Germany, created in 1835. Local industries include traditional metallurgy, optical instruments, glassware, and garments.

It grew up around a Benedictine convent founded in 852; the convent's abbess and the abbot of a local monastery ruled the town for centuries, until the institutions were dissolved in 1802 and local governance passed to Prussia. The town grew with the industrial expansion of the 19th century to become the largest industrial city of the Ruhr district. The French occupied it from 1923 to 1925. In World War II it served as the center of German war industry, and as such was heavily bombed. It has been considerably rebuilt and most of its building today date from the 20th and 21st centuries. Its cultural institutions include an opera house and company, the Museum Folkwang that houses 19th- and 20th-century art, and the Villa Hügel, formerly the residence of the Krupp family, famous as industrialists and arms manufacturers, which now hosts for cultural events and conferences. Essen is a railway junction and commercial trade center. Its economic activities include coal processing, steel making, and the manufacture chemicals, glass items, textiles, and precision instruments. Despite the industrialization, the southern part of the city has plenty of parks and small wooded areas. The estimated population for 2004 was 581,600.

Chartered in 1373, it was ruled by the counts of Moers, then by the House of Orange from 1600, then by Prussia from 1702. The town prospered in textile manufacture, particularly of silk and velvet, begun by Protestant and Mennonite refugees from the 17th century. An important battle of the Seven Years' War was fought near there in 1758, in which Ferdinand, duke of Brunswick, defeated the French. The city expanded greatly in size and acquired a harbor on the Rhine through the annexation of several neighboring towns in the early 20th century. It suffered greatly in the two World Wars, being occupied by the Allies from 1918 to 1926, and then severely damaged in World War II. The modern city is a cultural center, with a restored castle housing the Museum Burg Linn, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Museum, the Museum Haus Lange of modern art, and a textile museum. It is also a rail transportation center and produces steel, clothing, machinery, and chemicals.

It was founded by free miners in the 12th century and fast became an influential silver-mining center, and home of the mining code ""Freiberger Stadtrecht,"" established in 1296. It was the largest city in Saxony until the 16th century, its economic center and home to its mint. The Reformation was introduced here by Henry the Pious in 1536. The Thirty Years War of the 17th century and the French occupation of 1806 to 1814 inflicted great destruction on Freiberg. It never quite regained its former high status. The silver mines closed in 1913, and in 1936 the lead, zinc, and pyrites mines became state property. The modern town is still a mining center and now also has manufacturing industries for porcelain, electrical and precision instruments, leather, textiles, and machinery. Its historic architecture includes its Old City, which has three sections: the Civitas Saxonium, which is a network of narrow alleys around the St. Nicholas Church, the Lower Market, and the Upper City with its wealth of medieval building, including the town hall, 1410-1416, the cathedral, 1484-1501 with its 1230 Golden Portal from an earlier church, and some remaining sections of the old town wall. The Freiberg Mining Academy, founded 1765, is the world's oldest mining education institution.

Celts and Germanic people occupied the site in the first century BCE and by the Romans in the first and second centuries CE. The Franks took it over around 500, when if probably gained the name Frankfurt, meaning ""ford of the Franks, but was first mentioned as such by Charlemagne's biographer in the late 8th century. In 1356 it was designated the official site of the election of the German kings. It was a free imperial city from 1372 to 1806, then Napoleon I made it first the seat of government for the Confederation of the Rhine, then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. From 1816 to 1866 it was the seat of the Germann Federal Diet and thus de facto the capital of the German states. Following the Seven Weeks' War in 1866, it fell under Prussian rule where it remained until after World War I. It suffered heavy damage from bombardment in World War II, and most of its medieval Old City was destroyed. Historic structures that survived include the 8th-century Benedictine monastery, the Römer or medieval city hall, the 155-foot Eschenheim Tower, St. Bartholomew's Cathedral dating from 1239, and the Church of St. Paul. Modern Frankfurt am Main is a commercial and industrial center, famous for its many trade fairs, including the international book, car, and computer fairs. It is known for the manufacture of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, printing materials, and processed foods, especially sausages. It is a transportation center with a busy railway hub and the largest airport in Germany.

Salt mines opened here in the 12th century, sparking a long rivalry over the trade with nearby Salzburg. The town was ruled by the provosts of the Augustinian abbey from 1300. Austria occupied it in 1704 and annexed it in 1805. After 1810, after a brief period of French rule, it was ceded to the kingdom of Bavaria. Some medieval architecture remains, notably the abbey church and the castle occupied first by the provost-rulers then by the kings of Bavaria in the warm summer months. In the 1930s and 1940s, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders had chalets on the Obersalzberg overlooking the town. Hitler's chalet was bombed in World War II and in the 1950s was leveled and had trees planted over it. The local economy depends primarily on tourism, and the salt mines still function.

Celts and Germanic people occupied the site in the first century BCE and by the Romans in the first and second centuries CE. The Franks took it over around 500, when if probably gained the name Frankfurt, meaning ""ford of the Franks, but was first mentioned as such by Charlemagne's biographer in the late 8th century. In 1356 it was designated the official site of the election of the German kings. It was a free imperial city from 1372 to 1806, then Napoleon I made it first the seat of government for the Confederation of the Rhine, then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. From 1816 to 1866 it was the seat of the Germann Federal Diet and thus de facto the capital of the German states. Following the Seven Weeks' War in 1866, it fell under Prussian rule where it remained until after World War I. It suffered heavy damage from bombardment in World War II, and most of its medieval Old City was destroyed. Historic structures that survived include the 8th-century Benedictine monastery, the Römer or medieval city hall, the 155-foot Eschenheim Tower, St. Bartholomew's Cathedral dating from 1239, and the Church of St. Paul. Modern Frankfurt am Main is a commercial and industrial center, famous for its many trade fairs, including the international book, car, and computer fairs. It is known for the manufacture of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, printing materials, and processed foods, especially sausages. It is a transportation center with a busy railway hub and the largest airport in Germany.

Four medieval churches have been restored, and the remains of four moated castles and Saxon and Carolingian fortresses. Significant modern architecture includes the Westphalia Hall, built 1952, one of Europe's largest halls, and the synagogue built in 1956.

Nearby remains of Viking settlements indicate its possible origin. The city became a bishopric in 948, and had many religious institutions. It flourished in medieval times, but declined after the Reformation. With the 19th century came an expanded harbor, the railway, and industrialization, making it the foremost city on the Jutland Peninsula. It is now a busy port and manufacturing center, and is the nation's 3rd largest city. Despite industrialization, much of its old architecture remains, notably the 11th-century crypt of St. Nicholas under the Church of Our Lady and the 13th-century Flamboyant Gothic Arhus Cathedral dedicated to St. Clement, both in the Old Town section of the city. Other features are the Den Gamle By, an open-air museum that is a replica of an early Danish town, Arhus University founded in 1928, and an academy of music.

3,Deutschland,Rheinland-Pfalz,Trier,00003321,Trier,,,,,inhabited places,"The German city of Trier is situated on the Mosel river, just east of the border with Luxembourg. It was the ancient capital of the Germanic Treveri tribe, who were conquered by the Romans around 15 BCE. It became an episcopal see in the fourth century, and the main Christian city north of the Alps. The Franks captured it in the fifth century but it remained a Christian center, becoming an archbishopric in 815 and flourishing thereafter as a commercial and administrative center. Its archbishops became powerful temporal princes, and a university was founded, operating from 1473 to 1797. It was taken over by France in 1797, and n 1815 by Prussia. The 19th century saw rapid growth, however, this was interrupted by the two World Wars. Trier has been rebuilt and become a cultural and commercial center again. It has retained much of its historic architecture, both Roman and German. Roman structures include the basilica of the emperors that was later converted into a Romanesque cathedral. Later German structures include the Market Cross of 958, the Abbey Church of St. Mattias, 1127-1160, with the saint's tomb, and the Electoral Palace of 1614. The University of Trier was founded in 1970. Local industries are diverse, featuring the production of textiles, beer, and machinery. Trier is also a transportation hub for shipping and trading goods, especially wines. Trier's famous natives include St. Ambrose, born here in 339, and Karl Marx, born 1818. The calculated population for 2005 was 100, 649.",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7004447,,,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7004447,,,1

On the west bank was the city of the dead, containing the valleys of the royal tombs, royal mortuary temples, and the houses of priests and workers devoted to the dead. The Egyptians called the city Wase, and later Nowe. The ancient Greeks called it Thebes, probably because it reminded them of their own Thebes, with its large gates.

Chartered as a free imperial city in the twelfth century, it thrived as medieval trading and textile manufacturing center, and was a member of the Protestant Schmalkaldic League in the Reformation. It declined during the religious wars of the 16 and 17th centuries. It went to Bavaria in 1802, then to Württemberg in 1810. By the mid-20th century, it had expanded as an industrial and commercial hub. Although it was severely damaged during World War II, it has rebuilt and restored much of its historic architecture, including the medieval city walls. Its large Gothic cathedral, the Münster, begun in 1377 and finished in 1890, boasts one of the tallest spires in the world at 528 feet. The city has diversified industries, and has a university founded in 1967.

The land consists mainly of mountains and high plateaus, measuring some 27,241 square miles in area. The area was inhabited by Celts in centuries before the Common Era. It was conquered by Rome in 38 BCE, ravaged by Lombards in the 5th century, then settled by Marcomanni and Baiuoarii ca. 520. It formed the core of the Frankish dukedom from the 6th century, and became Christian by the 9th century. In 788, Charlemagne overthrew the last Frankish duke and brought Bavaria into the Carolingian Empire. It joined the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th century. In 1180 the emperor gave Bavaria to the count palatine Otto of Wittelsbach, the founder of the powerful dynasty that ruled Bavarian until 1918. Bavaria greatly expanded its territory over time, though it suffered greatly during the War of Spanish Succession. In the 18th century it first opposed then allied itself with Napoleonic France, and in 1805 was elevated from a duchy to a kingdom. The kingdom switched allegiance between Austria and Prussia several times in the turbulent 19th century, finally joining the German Empire under Prussian leadership. It retained a great deal of autonomy however, in 1918 the royal dynasty was deposed and after much civil strife, in August 1919 Bavaria joined the Weimar Republic. After World War II, Bavaria was in the American-occupied zone, and became a state in the new Federal Republic of Germany. The modern state's economy is largely industry- and trade-based, with forestry and agriculture constituting only about 10%. The state has a rich cultural life, with music and theater taking high prominent, and traditional folk art still strong. The capital is Munich.

The Soviet-ruled East Berlin, together with the rest of East Germany, and West Berlin, a western enclave within East Germany, were governed separately from 1949. A concrete wall physically divided the city in 1961. The Berlin Wall and the political separation of the two parts of the city ended in 1989 as the communist eastern government collapsed. In 1990 the united Berlin became once again the capital of a united Germany. The largest city in Germany, its 2011 estimated population was 3.5 million.","federated state, capital and largest city of Germany",http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003712,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q64,https://d-nb.info/gnd/4005728-8,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003712,,,0

The Romans knew of and used its mineral springs, though the town as such was first mentioned only in the 12th century. The town passed to the house of Hesse in 1521, and it became the independent city and margraviate of Hesse-Homburg in 1622. It became a famous and fashionable bathing and gambling resort in the 19th century and famed for the local Homburg hat, popularized by Edward, Prince of Wales in the 1890s.Starting from the end of World War I, the town expanded to include a growing residential district and industries such as the manufacture of machinery, leather goods, textiles, and baked goods.

The fourth-largest city in Germany, it serves the entire Rhine region as its historical, economic, and cultural center. The first settlement on the site was a Roman fortification. Franks captured it in 456. It became the seat of a powerful archbishop, and became independent in 1288. A member of the Hanseatic League, it declined in the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century. Prussia took it over in 1815. The heavy shipping traffic of the Rhine and the intersection of major east-west trade routes at the city caused it to recover and prosper. The inner city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II. The city has been rebuilt and continues as a commercial center. Some historic architecture survives, notables the great Gothic cathedral in the middle of the inner city, which was designated as a World Heritage site in 1996. Cologne has a wealth of museums and galleries, notably the Wallraf-Richartz and Ludwig museum complex, whose collection encompasses medieval art to modern works, the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, and the Schnütgen Museum of medieval ecclesiastical art. Educational institutions include the University of Cologne, founded in 1388. The modern city has a highly diversified economy, and serves as a banking center as well as a manufacturing city, notably producing motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and the city's famous eau de cologne, made since the beginning of the 18th century.

Celts and Germanic people occupied the site in the first century BCE and by the Romans in the first and second centuries CE. The Franks took it over around 500, when if probably gained the name Frankfurt, meaning ""ford of the Franks, but was first mentioned as such by Charlemagne's biographer in the late 8th century. In 1356 it was designated the official site of the election of the German kings. It was a free imperial city from 1372 to 1806, then Napoleon I made it first the seat of government for the Confederation of the Rhine, then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. From 1816 to 1866 it was the seat of the Germann Federal Diet and thus de facto the capital of the German states. Following the Seven Weeks' War in 1866, it fell under Prussian rule where it remained until after World War I. It suffered heavy damage from bombardment in World War II, and most of its medieval Old City was destroyed. Historic structures that survived include the 8th-century Benedictine monastery, the Römer or medieval city hall, the 155-foot Eschenheim Tower, St. Bartholomew's Cathedral dating from 1239, and the Church of St. Paul. Modern Frankfurt am Main is a commercial and industrial center, famous for its many trade fairs, including the international book, car, and computer fairs. It is known for the manufacture of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, printing materials, and processed foods, especially sausages. It is a transportation center with a busy railway hub and the largest airport in Germany.

It is about 16 miles east of Brussels. The settlement was founded in the ninth century at the site of a fortress built by the German emperor to halt advancing Normans. In the eleventh century it was the residence of the counts of Leuven, and later of Brabant from 1190. It grew to be a major cloth producer and one of the largest cities in Europe in 14th century, but declined after a citizens' revolt in 1379 was put down and many of its weavers fled to England and Flanders. The Catholic University of Leuven was founded in 1425, making the city famous as a seat of learning. In1914, when Germany invaded it, the university's famous library and the Cloth Workers' Hall, built1193, were burned. It sustained much damage in both World Wars. It nevertheless continues to be a center of culture, famed for its pointed Gothic town hall, built by Mathieu de Layens, the master mason, from 1448 to 1463. The Church of St. Peter, built first in the early 11th century, was twice destroyed before being rebuilt as a Gothic structure in1425-97, and it was again damaged in both world wars. The church contains two fine paintings by Dirck Bouts and fine ironwork and brasswork, much of it by Quentin Massys. Other notable medieval buildings include the ""Round Table,"" churches of St. Gertrude, St. Quentin, Saint-Michel, and St. James, two monasteries, and a béguinage, or retreat for secular nuns, with a 1305 church. The city's manufactures include food processing, beer brewing, leather goods, machinery, and chemicals, as well as sawmilling and bell founding.

The settlement grew around the castle of the counts palatine of Tübingen in the 11th century, and was first documented as a town in 1231. The town went to Württemberg in 1342, but changed hands among the Swabian League, Swedes, French, and Holy Roman Empire in the 17th century. Long renowned as a seat of learning, it was home to astronomer J Kepler, poet J Hölderllin, and philosopher G Hegel. The most notable of its historic structures is the Hohentübingen ducal castle, built in the 16th and 17th centuries and now housing several institutes belonging to the University of Tübingen. Modern industries include metal and machinery, textile, and paper manufactures. It is also a publishing center. The 2004 estimated population was 83,300.","town in central Baden-Württemberg, Germany",http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7004426,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3806,,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7004426,,,1

With Lübeck, it formed the Hanseatic League in 1241, and grew steadily over the next several centuries as a trade center. It accepted the Reformation in 1529 and became Protestant. Hamburg went its own way as the Hanseatic League gradually faded from existence; a stock exchange was founded there in 1558 and the bank of Hamburg was established in 1619. Napoleon I annexed it to the French Empire in 1810, and after his fall it joined the German Confederation, all the while retaining its traditional self-government to a large degree. The city was devastated by fire in 1842, but was rebuilt. It suffered terrible destruction by bombing in World War II, but its value as a port soon lead to its restoration and the resumption of its busy economic life.

First mentioned under this name in 1130, it was a fortress of the landgraves of Thuringia in the 12th century. It later became the seat of the landgraves of Hesse. St. Elizabeth of Hungary spent the last three years of her life in Marburg, and until the Reformation her bones lay in a shrine in St. Elizabeth's Church. Marburg was the site of debates between Martin Luther and other reformers in 1529 over the nature of the Eucharist. The city is known for the Gothic castle of the Hessian landgraves with its famous Rittersaal and chapel, begun in 1277 and completed in 1493. It was also the site of Europe's first Protestant University, founded 1527. Today its economy is driven largely by tourism, plus a few industries such as chemical and precision instrument manufacture.

The original Germanic settlements were occupied by Slavic Wends around 600 CE, who in turn were invaded by Saxons in the 12th century. The region was ruled by Danes in the 13th century, then by Swedes in the 17th century. It was divided into various states in the 16th- and 17th centuries, and in the 19 and 20th centuries. Following the First World War, the two grand duchies that then occupied the territory of Mecklenburg were abolished and replaced by elected governments. In 1934, the Nazi government unified the two parts into one state. Between 1945 and 1952 Mecklenburg was a state of East Germany, then was divided into three smaller official districts. Shortly before German reunification, the three separate districts were reunited as the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.  It is now part of the district of Neubrandenburg in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. ",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003675,,,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003675,,,1

In 1933, the first camp was established, for male inmates, most of whom were political prisoners. It closed in late 1933, with the inmates being moved to other camps. A camp for females was in operation from 1933-1938, and included political prisoners, as well as those who were pursued for racial or religious reasons. When the camp closed, many of the inmates were moved to Ravensbrück concentration camp. From 1940 to 1945, a youth concentration camp operated at Moringen, where pseudoscientific medical experimentation occurred and the inmates were subjected to inhumane treatment and conditions. There is a memorial on the site today. ",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/1040372,,,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/1040372,,,1

Romans documented a river crossing here in the 1st century BCE, and occupied a fortress here from the 1st to the 5th century CE. It was a Frankish town from the 9th century, and from the 13th century was a prosperous town, the capital of the electorate and archbishopric of Cologne. It was occupied by the French from 1794, and then annexed to Prussia in 1815. In the 19th century it grew famous as a rich, fashionable cit y, remaining as such until World War II, when it was heavily damaged. From 1949 to 1990 it was the capital of West Germany and grew in size and importance, annexing several nearby towns in 1969. Efforts were made to preserve the residential look of the city and so only restricted light industry was allowed, Bonn is a cultural center, famed as the birthplace of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. It has many musical institutions, including an orchestra, and hosts many national and international concerts, mainly in its modern concert hall, the Beethovenhalle. There are many private theaters and performance halls and a large municipal theater that hosts opera, drama, ballet, and musicals. There are two major museums. Its historic architecture includes a Romanesque basilica surmounted by five towers, and three old churches dating from the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries respectively. There is also the former Electorate Palace, now the Rhenish Friedrich Wilhelm University of Bonn, founded 1786 and the Poppelsdorf Palace, which has botanical gardens.

It is an important inland port, being connected to the North Sea German ports by the Rhine-Herne Canal. The Duisburg-Neuenkamp Bridge crosses the Rhine here, one of the world's longest span truss structures. The ancient settlement on the site, known to the Romans as Castrum Deutonis, became the seat of the Frankish kings in the 8th century. It was a free city of the Holy Roman Empire until taken over by Cleves in 1290, then by Brandenburg in 1614. It declined in the wars of the 17th century, but came back into prosperity as the seat of a Protestant university from 1655 until 1818. After 1880 it became industrialized and grew in the early to mid-20th century by annexing several surrounding towns and by acquiring a harbor. Severely damaged during World War II, it became one of western Europe's major iron and steel production centers, and in 1975 absorbed four more outlying cities. The modern city retains little of its historic architecture, but for the 12th-century Romanesque Premonstratensian Abbey Church and the 14th-century Gothic Salvator Church. Other cultural entities are art museums, including the Lehmbruck Museum in honor of famous local sculptor Wilhelm Lehmbruck, local history museums, and a zoo containing Germany's largest aquarium.  Besides iron and steel production, Duisburg has coal mining and the manufacture of heavy machinery, textiles, and metal and wooden items.

First documented in 1093, the town developed below the ancient castle of the counts von Broich, later going to the duchy of Berg, then to Prussia in 1814. It only received its charter in 1808. It grew much larger through the annexation of several nearby towns between 1878 and 1929. Historic architecture includes the 11th-century St. Peter's Church, which has been completely restored, Styrum Castle of the 13th century, a 13th-century Cistercian convent, and the residence of Gerhard Tersteegen, a famous hymn author who died in 1769. The city sustained heavy damage in World War II, and was rebuilt along modern plans with many parks and other open-air leisure and sports facilities. The city is a transportation center for road and rail, and an important river port. It is also a center of heavy industry, which is regulated by strict ordinance to preserve the human look and orientation of the city. Industries include iron founding, machine works, blast furnaces and rolling mills, and chemical and electronics manufactories. Mülheim houses the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research, where the Fischer-Tropsch process for liquefying coal and the Ziegler process for the production of polyethylene plastics were first invented.

Its major piece of historic architecture is its town hall, built as a castle in the 16th century. The modern city is a transportation hub, being at the junction of the Leipzig-Dresden and Berlin-Chemnitz rail lines. It is also a busy river port, the most important in northern Saxony.

From ca. 1020 to 1416 it was the seat of the Danish kings and until 1443 the capital of Denmark. It was the most important ecclesiastical center in Denmark until the Protestant Reformation. In 1658 the Treaty of Roskilde was signed there, ending war with Sweden. Historic architecture includes the cathedral, partly Romanesque and partly Gothic, begun in 1170 and finished in 1464. A long line of Danish kings and queens are buried there. The modern town is a major railway center and its industrial activities feature bacon factories, tanneries, distilleries, and a high school for industrial workers. It serves as a residential suburb of Copenhagen. The 2004 estimated population was 43,700.",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7003586,,,,,,1

By 1365, Samarkand had become part of the Timur empire, and was a flourishing city in the region. In 1500, the city was conquered by the Uzbeks, becoming part of the khanate of Bukhara. Samarkand had declined by the 17th century, becoming virtually uninhabited from ca. 1720-ca. 1780. Once the Russians had conquered the region, the city began to recover. Present-day Samarkand consists of an old city (containing many examples of 14th-20th century Central Asian architecture), and a 19th century section built by the Russians. In ancient times, the city had been on the Silk Road from India and China, and today its economy is largely agriculture-based. ",,http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7012290,,,,,,1

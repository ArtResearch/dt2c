Its territory forms the core of the medieval margraviate of Hessen, and extends west to east from the Rhine Plateau to the Thuringian Forest. The original landmargraviate of Hesse was founded from a portion of Thuringia. Its ruler, Henry I, came to hold the rank of prince in the Holy Roman Empire in 1292. Under Philip the Magnanimous, Hesse was twice partitioned and reunited, finally to be divided into four sections, one for each of his sons. In 1945 the modern state was created from the Hesse territories and part of Nassau. The capital is Wiesbaden and its largest city is Frankfurt am Main. The state is known for its educational institutions, and for the ruined castles and old churches along the Weser River, and the many half-timbered houses scattered throughout.

In 1180 the emperor gave Bavaria to the count palatine Otto of Wittelsbach, the founder of the powerful dynasty that ruled Bavarian until 1918. Bavaria greatly expanded its territory over time, though it suffered greatly during the War of Spanish Succession. In the 18th century it first opposed then allied itself with Napoleonic France, and in 1805 was elevated from a duchy to a kingdom. The kingdom switched allegiance between Austria and Prussia several times in the turbulent 19th century, finally joining the German Empire under Prussian leadership. It retained a great deal of autonomy however, in 1918 the royal dynasty was deposed and after much civil strife, in August 1919 Bavaria joined the Weimar Republic. After World War II, Bavaria was in the American-occupied zone, and became a state in the new Federal Republic of Germany.

It was home to Celtic Bori and Cotini peoples from the fourth century BCE.  Germanic tribes arrived in the period from the first to the fifth century CE, then the Avars in the sixth and seventh centuries, then a Slavic people called the Moravians, after the Morava River, in the late eighth century. It became an independent kingdom in the ninth century, Great Moravia, which comprised all of Bohemia, the southern part of modern Poland, and the western part of modern Hungary. Great Moravia dissolved with the death of its king Svatopluk in 894 and an overwhelming attack by the Magyars. Its lands were variously taken over by Hungary, Poland, and Bohemia. To Bohemia went Moravia proper, which was incorporated as a province in 1029. It came under the rule of the Austria Hapsburgs in 1526 together with Bohemia and Silesia. In the centuries of religious strife and rebellion that followed, Moravia was less rebellious than Bohemia and its largely Protestant population suffered less. Late in the 18th century what remained of Austrian Silesia was merged into Moravia and after 1848 it became an Austrian crown land with some autonomy. In 1918 it was joined to the new nation of Czechoslovakia. In 1949 it ceased to be a single administrative unit, being divided into several smaller provinces by the Czechoslovakian government. In 1960, the territory formerly known as Moravia and Silesia became Jihomoravsky, or South Moravia, and Severomoravsky, or North Moravia. These became part of the Czech Republic in 1993.
